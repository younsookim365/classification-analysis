# Classification Analysis
Classification analysis conducted in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Chosen Data Set and Its Suitability for Classification Analysis
The chosen diabetes prediction dataset is ideal for classification analysis due to:

- Inclusion of a binary target variable ("diabetes").
- Relevant predictor variables, such as age, BMI, and blood glucose levels.
- Diversity of data types, allowing for the application of various classification algorithms.
- Adequate sample size for effective model training.
- Reasonable class balance between diabetes and non-diabetes instances.

## Analysis Objectives
The analysis focuses on predicting diabetes using a chosen dataset. After preprocessing to handle missing values and encode variables, the data is split into training and testing sets. A Naïve Bayes Classifier is trained on the former, and its accuracy is evaluated on the latter. Visualizations depict the model's performance, and the impact of varying training/test splits is explored. The analysis also includes a comparison with the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to determine the most effective model for diabetes prediction based on provided attributes. The goal is to offer insights into the Naïve Bayes Classifier's performance and understand factors influencing its accuracy.
